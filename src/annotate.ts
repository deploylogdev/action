// Turning a manual-verification report into what a developer actually sees: an
// annotation on the line they just changed, and a job summary for everything
// that has no line to attach to.
//
// This module is pure. It decides what to render, never how to talk to GitHub,
// so the delivery rules can be tested against fixture reports without a
// workflow run. The `@actions/core` calls that consume it live at the edge.
//
// Two rules carry it.
//
// An annotation needs a reachable line. A CONFIRMED finding is scoped by the
// server to claims whose cited file is in the change, but two of them still
// cannot be pinned to a line in this run: a disappearance, where the value is
// gone and `line` is null, and a claim citing a sibling repository, which this
// checkout does not contain. Both are real findings. Neither gets guessed at a
// line it cannot reach; they go to the summary instead.
//
// The report's own `unverifiable` flag is deliberately absent from the view
// below. It is the coarse "not a clean bill of health" signal and it is not a
// drift signal, so exit status and copy come from the counts, which stay
// authoritative and separate. Leaving the field out of the type makes reading
// it by accident impossible rather than merely discouraged.

 * `ManualVerifyResponseSchema` in `src/lib/schemas.ts` in the deploylog
 * repository — the wire contract, not the `manual-verification.ts` service type
 * this comment used to name. The route validates its report against that schema
 * on the way out precisely so the two are allowed to differ, which makes the
 * service type the wrong thing to mirror. `api.ts` holds the full mirror; this

 * How many annotations GitHub will render, per level, per step.

 * as delivered that nobody will ever see. `planAnnotations` deliberately does NOT
 * apply this: it plans every finding it can place, and the bound belongs to
 * delivery, because a finding dropped before it is planned cannot be reported at
 * all — which is the defect rather than the fix.
 *
 * One constant, read by the code that emits and by the code that reports what was
 * shown. Two copies of this number is how the two sentences come to disagree.
