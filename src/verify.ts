// The verify run: fetch a report, deliver it, decide the exit status.
//
// Everything this module decides is already decided elsewhere. `planAnnotations`
// owns which findings can be shown inline, `decideVerdict` owns what fails the
// check, and `renderSummary` owns what a developer reads. This is the wiring, and
// it stays thin on purpose — a delivery rule that grows here is a rule with no
// test of its own, because the tests for those rules live beside them.
//
// The one judgment that belongs here is the annotation level. GitHub renders
// `error` as a red squiggle, and a red squiggle beside a green check reads as a
// broken checker, so findings are warnings until the check actually fails.
//
// A transport failure fails the run at every `fail-on` setting, including `none`.
// `none` means "no finding fails this check", never "this check cannot fail" — a
// checker that could not reach DeployLog has not vouched for anything, and
// reporting green for it is the false-clean this whole module is arranged
// against. The README says so in the same words.
